Conflictiong names (sql query to check for the best match for the actor's name that was typed by the user.  This query finds and returns the 
ID of the actor whose last name exactly matches what the user typed, and whose first name starts with the text typed by the user. If more 
than one such actor exists, you use the actor who has appeared in the most movies, breaking ties by choosing the actor with the lower-numbered ID:

Query part 1: Select * from actors where last_name = 'Bacon' AND first_name LIKE 'Kevin%' Order By film_count DESC, id ASC Limit 1;

Query part 2: Select * from actors where last_name = '$lastname' AND first_name LIKE '$firstname%' Order By film_count DESC, id ASC Limit 1;
